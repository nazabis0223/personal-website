    abstract = "{Ground-layer adaptive optics (GLAO) is generally used to improve the seeing for large-aperture ground-based optical telescopes across a wide field of view with uniform imaging quality. In this paper, a new criterion, which is defined as the weighted sum of the mean and mean-square-error values of the full width at half-maximum of the field-dependent point spread function of the image over the whole field of view, is proposed to evaluate GLAO performance uniformity. An analytic model of the GLAO-corrected point spread function based on spatial filtering methods is used to investigate the uniformity and image quality over the whole field of view for different guide-star layouts, telescope apertures, numbers of actuators for the deformable mirror, and turbulence profiles. Simulations are performed on the GLAO configurations for the 1-m New Vacuum Solar Telescope at Fuxian Solar Observatory. The results show that, compared with that of the classical evaluation, the correction uniformity improves by 63 per cent, with the resolution sacrificing only 5 per cent for a measured turbulence profile at Fuxian Solar Observatory. Furthermore, this criterion is applied to various requirements, and some critical system parameters are suggested for the wide field-of-view GLAO.}",
