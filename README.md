## mirsazzathossain.io

This is the source code for my personal website. I have used the following technologies to build this website.

- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Icons: [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- Content: [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- Content Management: [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.io/)
- Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Overview

- `app/*`: I have used next.js new `app` directory structure. This directory contains the main app.
- `components/*`: All custom components are stored in this directory.
- `content/*`: This directory contains all the content of the website. I have used [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.io/) to manage the content.
- `pages/*`: All API routes of the website are stored in this directory.
- `public/*`: This directory contains all the static assets of the website.
- `styles/*`: I have used Tailwind CSS for styling. This directory contains the Tailwind CSS global styles and some custom styles for the website.
- `utils/*`: This directory contains some utility functions.

**Note**: You have to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables to get the Spotify integration working.

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=yourspotifyclientid
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=yourspotifyclientsecret
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=yourspotifyrefreshtoken
